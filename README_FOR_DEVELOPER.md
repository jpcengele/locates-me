# Locates.me - Sovereign Global Addressing System

**A decentralized, offline-capable alternative to What3Words, built on Uber H3 and Format-Preserving Encryption.**

![Premium UI Demo](file:///Users/jpce/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a97aa2b9-5c24-420b-9228-880d4901696a/locates_me_premium_ui_demo_1766848807666.webp)

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Sovereign & Offline-First
- **No API Dependencies:** Address generation is purely mathematical (`Lat/Lon` ↔ `Words`).
- **Algorithm:** Uses **Uber H3 (Resolution 14)** for hexagonal gridding and **FF1 (Format-Preserving Encryption)** for address scrambling.
- **Zero Downtime:** The system works without an internet connection (except for map tiles).

### 2. Multi-Language Support
- **7 Supported Languages:** English, Arabic (RTL), Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Swahili.
- **Mathematical Translation:** Addresses are translated algorithmically, not via lookup tables.
- **RTL Support:** Full Right-to-Left layout support for Arabic.

### 3. "Sovereign Plates" (Claiming System)
- **Digital Scarcity:** Users can "claim" unique hexagonal locations.
- **Visual Feedback:** Claimed locations appear as **Gold Markers** on the map.
- **Custom Aliases:** Owners can assign custom names (e.g., `MY.HOME.01`) to their spots.

### 4. Premium UI/UX
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between Light and Dark themes.
- **Glassmorphism:** Modern, translucent UI elements.
- **Responsive:** Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.

## 🛠️ Developer Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+

### 1. Backend Setup
The backend is a FastAPI service handling H3 logic and the SQLite database.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
*Server runs at `http://localhost:8000`*

### 2. Frontend Setup
The frontend is a Next.js (React) application using Leaflet for maps.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
*App runs at `http://localhost:3000`*

## 📐 Architecture

### Core Logic (`backend/core/engine.py`)
The heart of the system. It converts coordinates to/from 3-word addresses.
1.  **Geo to H3:** `lat, lon` → `h3_index` (64-bit integer)
2.  **Scramble:** `h3_index` → `encrypted_int` (using FF1 with a secret key)
3.  **Encoding:** `encrypted_int` → `Word.Word.Word` (Base-N encoding using language vocabulary)

### Database (`backend/locates.db`)
Used **ONLY** for storing "Sovereign Plate" claims. The core addressing system does **not** use the database.

## ❓ FAQ

### Why H3 instead of Squares (What3Words)?
*   **Topological Uniformity:** Hexagons have uniform distance to all neighbors, making spatial analysis superior.
*   **Low Distortion:** H3 minimizes distortion across the globe compared to square grids.

### Is this compatible with What3Words?
**No.** This is a sovereign, open-source alternative. It does not rely on W3W's proprietary database.
